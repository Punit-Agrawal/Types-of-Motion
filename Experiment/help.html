    <h3>About the experiment</h3>
    <p>The experiment shows a electric circuit which demonstrates Working of Electric Fuse .<br><br>The primary use of an electric fuse is to protect electrical equipment from excessive current and to prevent short circuits or mismatched loads. </p>
    <h3>Animation control</h3>
    <p>The top line has animation controls. There are two states of the experiment.</p>
    <h3>The setup stage</h3>
    <p>The initial state is setup stage. In this stage, you can see a control window at the right. You have access to ONE slider.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Maximum Safe Voltage (V)&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;Maximum Safe voltage for our circuit. We will choose Fuse wire Accordingly to  he maximum safe voltage .</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once you setup the experiment, you can enter the animation stage by clicking the start button</p>
    <h3>The animation stage</h3>
    <p>In the animation stage, the circuit is now complete and the variable battery voltage start increasing every second thus increasing current in wires  .<br> voltmeter reading shows voltage in circuit and ammeter shows current in circuit.<br>At the time when voltage value get more then maximum safe voltage fuse wire melt and circuit breaks .</p>
    <p>The right hand panel now shows the values of current in the circuit , temperature of Fuse wire  and battery voltage. </p>
    <p>You can pause and resume the animation by using the pause/play button on the top line</p>
    <h2>Happy Experimenting</h2>
