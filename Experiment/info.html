<body><h2>Electricity  Fuse experiment concepts</h2>
    <h3>About the experiment</h3> 
    <p>The experiment shows a circuit consisting of resistance(electric bulb) , switch , variable battery , wires,  ammeter,   voltmeter,    and  a electric fuse when switch is closed.</p> 
    <p> Current starts to flow in the circuit when switch is ON as voltage increases result in increase in current and increase in temperature of fuse wire .</p>
	<p>  When an excessive amount of current flows through the fuse wire, the heating effect of current causes the fuse wire to melt and break the circuit.</p>
	<h3>Working of Electric Fuse .</h3> 
    <p>The primary use of an electric fuse is to protect electrical equipment from excessive current and to prevent short circuits or mismatched loads.<br><br> Under normal conditions, the fuse wire is part of the circuitry contributing to a complete loop for charges to flow through it. However, when an excessive amount of current flows through the fuse wire, the heating effect of current causes the fuse wire to melt. This is because the fuse wire is chosen such that it has a low melting point. This causes the loop to break thereby stopping the flow of charges in the circuit.</p> 
    <h3>Selection Of Fuse Wire .</h3> 
    <p>It is important to select a fuse that is properly specified for the circuit in consideration. For example, if the fuse that is used is underrated, then it will fail even under normal current conditions, unnecessarily breaking the circuit loop. <br><br>If it is overrated, then it will not break the circuit when required and cause equipment damage and failure and may even present itself as a safety hazard. .</p> 
    <h3>Temperature Increased in Fuse Wire</h3> 
    <p>The temperature increased in wire  is directly proportional to current in the circuit.</p>
